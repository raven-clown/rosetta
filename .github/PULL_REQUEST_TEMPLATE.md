Thanks for the pull request. The comments in this template are hidden when it renders, so you can leave them or delete them.

TITLE
Use Conventional Commits: `type(scope): what changes`, in lowercase and the imperative.
  fix(server): keep every line of a multiline SSE event
  feat(admin): list audit records by user
  docs(readme): show the Postgres setup
Types: feat, fix, docs, test, refactor, perf, build, ci, chore. Add `!` after the type for a breaking change, as in `feat(config)!: ...`.
The title becomes the commit on main, because pull requests are squash merged.

HOW TO WRITE THE DESCRIPTION
- Write for someone who hasn't read the issue. Lead with what changes for a user, a caller or an operator, then say why.
- Plain English, short sentences, active voice. "Prefix every data line" reads better than "This PR aims to ensure that data lines are prefixed".
- Show before and after when it helps: a request, a config snippet, a log line or an error message, in a code block.
- Name files, functions, flags, config keys and endpoints in backticks.
- State facts. Skip words like robust, seamless, comprehensive or powerful. If you measured something, give the number and how you measured it.
- Use bullets for separate items, not for one thought cut into pieces.
- Keep it as short as the change allows. A one-line fix can have a three-line description.

CHECKS
Workflows from a fork start once a maintainer approves them, so the checks can show as waiting for a while. That's expected.

Closes #

## What changes

<!-- What a user, caller or operator sees differently. Before and after, if it helps. -->

## Why

<!-- The problem this solves. If the issue already explains it, one line and the link is enough. -->

## How it works

<!-- The approach in a few sentences and the main files touched. Mention an alternative you ruled out if a reviewer would likely ask about it. -->

## How I tested it

<!--
The tests you added and what each one proves. For a bug fix, say that the new test fails on main and passes here.
Anything you ran by hand, with the command and the part of the output that matters.
-->

## What I didn't test

<!-- Platforms, providers, clients or setups you couldn't try. "Nothing" is a fine answer. -->

## rosetta checks

<!-- Tick what applies and delete the rest. -->

Protocols this touches: <!-- MCP, A2A, ACP, AG-UI, or none -->

- [ ] Each protocol touched was tried with a real client, named in "How I tested it"
- [ ] Golden files under `testdata/` changed only through `go test ./protocol/... -update` for a deliberate wire change, and the description explains the diff
- [ ] The root `rosetta` package still imports no protocol SDK. Only the adapters, `tools/mcp` and `agents/a2a` import one
- [ ] A change to `rosetta.Agent` or the event types keeps existing agents compiling, or the title has `!`
- [ ] In stdio mode logs go to stderr and stdout carries only the protocol
- [ ] rosetta's own API keys are still never sent to transponder, airlock or a remote A2A agent
- [ ] `traceparent`, `tracestate`, `X-Request-ID` and `X-Project` still reach transponder and airlock
- [ ] A new config key works from YAML and from its `ROSETTA_` environment variable, and `examples/rosetta.yaml` shows it
- [ ] A workaround for a bug in a protocol SDK links the upstream issue next to the code

## Checklist

- [ ] Tests cover the change, and a bug fix has a test that fails without it
- [ ] Unit tests use no network, and wait on conditions instead of a bare `time.Sleep`
- [ ] `make check` passes (lint, tests and the 80% coverage check)
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has a line under Unreleased, if users will notice the change
- [ ] README and docs are updated, if usage, config or commands changed
- [ ] Nothing breaks for current users, or the title has `!` and the description says what breaks and how to move over
